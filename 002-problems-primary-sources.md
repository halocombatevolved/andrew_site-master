# Common problems with primary sources.
If you do not have enough primary sources take a look at the bibliography of one of the papers you already have. In most cases you can use a couple of the same resources to get your point across.

If you are having trouble formatting your bibliography to meet the needs of the class consult owl perdue or easybib.

If you havenâ€™t realized it yet, each class has a different format style for the bibliography. English classes tend to use MLA format. History classes use Chicago style. Always check with your professor to make sure that you are using the correct format.

The difference of a comma may separate one style from another so be careful when using automatic citation tools. You could refer to a citation manual if you want to make sure what you have is correct.
