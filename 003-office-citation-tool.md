# How to use microsoft office’s built in citation tool
The first step in creating citations in microsoft word is opening the references tab on the top.
Select the citation style that you need from the drop down menu then click on “Manage Sources”.
From here you will be entering in all the information that you have on your sources. Make sure that you select the correct type of source for each entry.
To create a bibliography click on bibliography and pick the header that your professor is looking for.
After creating your bibliography you can still add or remove sources, just make sure to right click on your bibliography and “update” it periodically. In the “manage sources” window make sure that you create a citation for each source on the “current list” otherwise it will not appear in the bibliography.
