# How to find primary sources for research papers

For most scientific  papers professors establish requirements for what they want out of the bibliography, literature cited or whatever they want to call it.
Treat their requirements as a minimum. Find enough resources so that you can put citations scattered throughout each paragraph. Avoid citing the same sources too many times in a row.

In most cases the only websites that  you need to search through to find primary sources are google, jstore, pubmedcentral, and ncbi.

Once you’ve found a primary source that looks good to you, read through the abstract.
Even if you found a source that refutes the point that you are trying to make doesn’t mean that it can’t be useful.
The most important information that you can get from any primary source is the citation. Make sure that what you found has all the publication information you need to create a citation.
If what you found does not contain enough publication information copy the title and search it in google. Hopefully one of the first couple of results will have what you are missing.

The easiest way to determine if a primary source is any good is to use the ctrl+F function on the web page or pdf. Search for terms that fit your topic. For example, if you are writing a paper on a specific species of animal make sure that the paper talks about that animal.
For older papers there may be a pdf but the text is not formatted so that you can easily scan through it.
